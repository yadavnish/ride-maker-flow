PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Commuters today face major inconvenience while booking rides due to the
fragmented nature of existing ride-hailing services. They constantly switch
between multiple apps like Uber, Ola, and Rapido to compare fares, driver
availability, and waiting times.
This repetitive and time-consuming process results in confusion, data
redundancy, and poor accessibility, especially for users who want a quick,
seamless, and unified ride-booking experience.
There is a clear need for a centralized and intelligent platform that can
aggregate real-time data from multiple ride providers, allow instant ride
booking, and enable natural, conversational interaction — all in one place,
without the hassle of juggling between different apps.

SOLUTION:
I created Ride Maker flow, an AI-powered ride-booking platform that brings together
multiple cab services like Uber, Ola, and Rapido into a single, unified interface — fully
accessible through WhatsApp.
The platform aggregates real-time ride data from different providers, enabling users to
compare fares, ETAs, and driver details instantly without opening multiple apps.
Through a simple WhatsApp chat, users can book rides, check availability, and view trip
history, all through natural, conversational messages powered by an AI Chatbot Assistant.
With one-click booking and instant confirmation, Ride Maker flow eliminates app fatigue
and provides a seamless, accessible, and intelligent mobility experience for everyone —
anytime, anywhere, directly from WhatsApp.
